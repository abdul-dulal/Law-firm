          <span className="text-xl ">Authorization</span> in system security is
          the process of giving the user permission to access a specific
          resource or function. This term is often used interchangeably with
          access control or client privilege. In secure environments,
          authorization must always follow authentication. Users should first
          prove that their identities are genuine before an organizationâ€™s
          administrators grant them access to the requested resources <br />
          <span className="text-xl">Authentication</span> is about validating
          your credentials like User Name/User ID and password to verify your
          identity. The system determines whether you are what you say you are
          using your credentials. In public and private networks, the system
          authenticates the user identity via login passwords. Authentication is
          usually done by a username and password, and sometimes in conjunction
          with factors of authentication, which refers to the various ways to be
          authenticated. Read more: Difference between Authentication and
