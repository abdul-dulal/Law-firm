          S Hossain and Associates always try our best to find out what is the
          desired outcome of the clients from <br /> the services we are
          rendering to them ; and we plan our course of action to meet the
          desired goal of the client and <br /> thus we i.e. S Hossain &amp;
          Associates Bangladesh Law Firm and our client walk in the same path
          and try together to reach the <br />
          common goal.
